			<h4>The assignment</h4>

			<p>
				"√òlklubben" was a group project where we within the group had to find a common passion, and
				then base a website on that passion. Besides desiging an inviting website, one of the main
				focusses was to make a fucntioning sorting system.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>The process</h4>

			<p>
				We were tasked with starting of by making the logo for our site. It was a difficiult task
				bacuse when we designed the logo, we still had no idea which "kind" of beer club we were
				about to create. <br /> But we ended up with a logo with a very universal expression, which
				we were all satisfied with. <br /> Another big task was making the sorting system. In the end
				it was made by creating a distant database, which we pulled data from into an array that we could
				use to sort the beers.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>The solution</h4>
			<p>
				We ended up with this dark, cozy site with a bodega vibe, supported by the background images
				which ties the site together.
