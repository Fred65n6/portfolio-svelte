			<h4>The assignment</h4>

			<p>
				This was a group project where we had to make a campaignsite, which purpose was to get young
				people in Copenhagen to buy an annual pass to "Teater Grob". The site had to include a clear
				concept as well as a campaign video and videos for social media.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>The process</h4>

			<p>
				We started of the project by brainstorming ideas for a slogan which we could base our
				concept on. After a lot of iterations we ended up with a slogan which translates to "Do you
				also miss more drama in your everyday life?". We also came up with the idea that the
				campaign should include a bid to gather N√∏rrebro, which is why we came up with the vouchers
				that give you a discount in select local buisnesses when you use your annual pass.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>The solution</h4>

			<p>
				The final solution, is a campaign site build in wordpress. My main area of responsibility
				was desiging and setting up the website. The concept was presented for some representatives
				from "Teater Grob" who were very delighted with our solution.
