			<h4>The assignment</h4>

			<p>
				In this project we had to design a website for a fictitious client who rents out rehearsel
				spaces. First and foremost the project was about making an inviting design as well as
				including a lot of different information.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>The process</h4>

			<p>
				In this project we had our first real meeting with Figma which we used to make the
				prototypes as well as developing design systems. Other that that we also had to used the
				framework Tailwind to code the site, which was also a first.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>The solution</h4>

			<p>
				In our final solution we chose to use the red color to create a visual identity, as well as
				we chose to streamline the pictures by taking out some saturation and giving them a kind of
				raw grainy look. The site contains different information such as pricing, who "Musiklofet"
				is, and a flow for booking rooms.
